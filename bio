## Anita Martin
### Hello and welcome!

<p> My name is Anita Martin. I am from the small town of Crownpoint, New Mexico. I am Native American from the Dine Nation, 
more broadly known as the Navajo Nation. For the past ten years, I have been working in the warehouse industry. It put food 
on the table, paid my bills, and I had extra money along the way. While this schedule was sustaining economically, the repetitive 
routine became very pronounced. The excitement did not compare to when I originally started my career in 2003 (high school graduation).
I knew in high school I wanted to pursue a profession working with computers and information technology so, I took extra math courses
to advance my knowledge. Upon completion of high school, I applied my newfound skills at ITT Technical Institute in Albuquerque,
New Mexico where I received an Associates Degree in Information Technology two years later. During the course on my education,
I also worked as an hourly employee with Dollar Tree. I worked my way up to an Assistant Store Manager and eventually Store Manager 
which coincided with my graduation date in May of 2005. I had the opportunity to help open the newest store in the district in Gallup, 
New Mexico. This was an exciting time for me as I was the youngest of all the managers in addition to having a brand-new store to run.
As one would imagine, I had a lot of eyes and pressure on me. The first year our store was number one each month beating our quotas for
sales and hours. With all the excitement and the nice salary, plus the added bonuses each month, my degree was put on the back burner.
With this success also came a price since I did not have the time to utilize my degree in IT. It was not until I started with DISH back
in September of 2009 that my love for computers came to the forefront again. With DISH, I was able to apply pieces of knowledge and 
skills I learned back in college and used this to my advantage. Although it was a nice change from retail, times were changing and 
changing fast in the computer world. I felt like my degree was obsolete by this time. Moreover, I kept working harder and eventually
became the Warehouse Manager with DISH and continued this role up until May of 2019. </p>


<p> Last year, I had a life-changing event that affected my family and I. My eldest brother passed away from kidney disease.
After 12 years of my brother being on dialysis, his body could not take it anymore. I was completely heart broken since I have always
looked up to him. In his lifetime, he was able to open his own jewelry business and succeed all while he spent four hours a day,
three to four times a week hooked up to a dialysis machine. He taught me a lot and was very humble of his accomplishments. 
He showed me no matter where you come from, any goal can be accomplished as a result of resiliency and hard work. After this
unfortunate event, it was what pushed me to go after what I started working on back in high school. I was browsing the internet
and came across the New Mexico Information Technology Apprenticeship Program (NMITAP) which sparked my interest and I immediately
applied. After being accepted and almost a year later on their waiting list, I came to find NMITAP started working with 
CNM Ingenuity and found out about the Bootcamps. This was an opportunity of a lifetime that I could not refuse. 
This opportunity is the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. Fast forward to now, I am currently a student in the JAVA+ Android boot camp
where I am learning about the depths of coding. Although I am coming from a non-programming background, I put every last effort
into studying to ease the intimidation. So far, the instructors, assistants, and the rest of the staff have been helpful and go
above and beyond to make sure each student will succeed. I am grateful and excited to learn more about computer programming. </p>
