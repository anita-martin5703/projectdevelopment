## Weekly Reflections
 - What did I learn this week?
 - What I felt like an accomplishment?
 - How have I grown from this expereince?
 - How has my perception changed?
 - Why do I love coding?
  
  - Week One & 2
    - I had started classes on May 20th, 2019 and its been exactly 13 days. My brain has never been so pumped up, overloaded, excited, and stressed out all at once. LOL The first week was pretty hectic learning and cramming all the tools we need to start a project on our own. I am for the most part understanding it, but I feel like its not enough. I try to do some extra readings and doing the exercises in the book but I get hung up on one problem and I end up spending too much time on it and I forget about everything else. I am learning but its a slow process for me. As I take some extra, extra readings, youTube clips, and websearching, it is definatly helping me out. So far what I have accomplished is learning the basics of programming. Learning the shortcuts and proper structure is what I want to focus on, and of course learning the coding itself. My preception changed this week after talking with Karen that this whole process will take time I just need to focus on some of the postitive as well. Before I was really putting myself down as I would see my other classmates just catching on to things faster than me, so I felt a little out of place for a while. Why do I love coding? So far I love it because this is somnthing I have wanted to do forever and I am finally to do this! Although its a love-hate relationship I am not going to give up anytime soon.

## Pro Dev Activities

### Quanititive Accomplishments
   - Working at DISH I oversaw just under one Million dollars of inventory. I had to track it, order it, ship it out mainly watch our shrink on it.
   - I was also in charge of overseeing about 70-90 technicians’ individual inventory. We had to replenish every week to make sure they did not run out of equipment for installs.
   - We had about 90 vehicles in our fleet so I had to maintain the maintacnce on them. From oil changes, brake changes, windshield replacements, etc..

### Qualitative Accomplishment
   - Great communicator – I have a great communications skills through emails, phone etiquette, and face-to-face. Large groups usually more than 20 I start to panic a little. 
   - Organizer - I am a great organizer, as I have eveything that I need to do in my calender. What I was taught was "Make time for it or you won't get to it."
   - People person - I have a belief that we are our own individual person and that makes us unique. So I like to talk to people, even though I know I come across as shy or in my own zone, once I start to warm up to people I like to have conversations about everything.
    
### What do I bring to the table?
<p>Warehouse Inventory process – knew the ends and outs of the process of inventory related tasks.
Great with people – I had about at 70 to 90 techs that I was working with to track inventory on a weekly schedule. Used email, phone and person-to-person interactions.Great under pressure – working with deadlines when projects were pushed on to me. Had a time frame of due by the end of the day or a month.Well organized – kept our warehouse organized so that we can easily pull items quickly and efficiently.
Excel was my friend – I had to work on a daily basis with excel building models to help track inventory, building schedules to help keep track of things that were completed and not completed.Hard worker – all the positions that I held I started off from the very bottom and worked my way to a management position.</p>
