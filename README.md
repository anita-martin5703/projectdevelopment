## Weekly Reflections
 - What did I learn this week?
 - What I felt like an accomplishment?
 - How have I grown from this expereince?
 - How has my perception changed?
 - Why do I love coding?
  
  - Week 6 to Week 8
  <p> The past three weeks have been a blur, from starting and finishing up our Android Projects to immediately starting our Capstones again (due in 2 week i might add), and in between all that we had to cram in all sorts of information to be prepared for quizzes, exam #2 and Pro Dev activities. I will honestly tell you that I never had this much stress in my life, hahaha. ALthough all good stress, not sure if that is a thing, but I would rather have that feeling because at the end of the day I am accomplishing something big for myself. My biggest accomplishment the past weeks is that I turn in my Android Project, on time. Although not as complete as I wanted but hey that gives me more practice to write more code in my spare time. I did not realize all the documentaion that went into it, now I know to give myself adquate time in the future so that I am not rushing around at the last minute. I believe that I have grown a lot the past weeks. I can say that I never thought that I would make it this far. Learning about time management, balancing personal and school life, and on top of that a whole crap load of coding! I have to say that my preception has changed a lot. Talking with a friends of mine I have to give myself more credit. I did not think that I could build a runnable, well sort of runnable app. LOL. I still love coding of course. I think in week 7th I lost traction for a bit. I was at a breaking point because I had some family matters pop up and on top of that I had to get ready for the Exam #2. I also was losing why I came to the bootcamp in the first place. It was a hard week for sure, but just having friends motivate me and classmates even just asking how I was doing made my day. All in all I made it through and time to finish off strong. After some rest of course! :)   **I love coding still**</p>
  
  - Week 5
  <p> This past week was not a bad week. I am super happy because I am passing this bootcamp. Yay!! We started on the first few steps of our individual Android Projects. It is a little scary because we are doing this all on our own. However we do have each other and Nick & Chris to help out. This week I learned more about Android Studio, more specifically, Floating buttons and a Snackbar, and I was disappointed too there was no food involved! hahaha. The biggest thing that I accomplished was building my teambuilding skills. We made our wireframes with my group its was quite easy but we all had lunch and that was a gerat time to bond. (David, Alana, Denelle are in my group). What I have took away from all this is that each of us in our group have different qualities and we can use each other to lean on for support. I know more about my team both Alana and Denelle have great leadership skills. David is such a whiz with all this computer stuff. They are all amazing! :) Oh I love coding this week! I am working slowing on it but went through some Coding Bat exercises. Hope to do more this week!</p>
 
  - Week 3 & 4
    <p>WHOA! is all I have to say for weeks 3 and 4. We had our very first exam and boy-oh-boy was that intense! At the beginnig of week 4 I was not prepared but after I met with my tutor Rebecca I felt a little accomplished. It was good to hear that the normal jitters and the brain overloading was normal. She was great and I am scheduling more sessions with her this week. On Wednesday the quiz was good. I was able to retake it and got a passing grade so that was great! The written part for Exam #1 came out better that I expected hahaha. I was proud of myself. The Exam #1 part #2 I struggled with. I went in early to get a head start on it. The first question was ok I was able to complete that. As I progressed along it was getting harder and harder. I had to take a few extra breaks. Again I feel like I should know this by now! and I start getting frustrated. I hoped to have accomplished more but I did not. After a day off from everything I know that I have to do more. I know that I need more practice in the coding part so my goal for the next week or so is to go through as much of the coding bat exercises as I can. Coding is still a love/hate relationship, at the end of this week it was more of a hate thing hahaha.
    
  
  - Week 1 & 2
    <p>I had started classes on May 20th, 2019 and its been exactly 13 days. My brain has never been so pumped up, overloaded, excited, and stressed out all at once. LOL The first week was pretty hectic learning and cramming all the tools we need to start a project on our own. I am for the most part understanding it, but I feel like its not enough. I try to do some extra readings and doing the exercises in the book but I get hung up on one problem and I end up spending too much time on it and I forget about everything else. I am learning but its a slow process for me. As I take some extra time on the readings, watching youTube clips, and lots of websearching, it is definatly helping me out. So far what I have accomplished is learning the basics of programming. Learning the shortcuts and proper structure is what I want to focus on, and of course learning the coding itself. I would like a tutor to help speed up this pcocess if I can. My preception changed this week after talking with Karen that this whole process will take time for ME. I just need to focus on some of the postitive as well. Before I was really putting myself down as I would see my other classmates catching on to things faster than I, so I felt a little out of place for a while. Why do I love coding? So far I love it because this is something I have wanted to do forever and I am actually to do this! Although its a love-hate relationship I am not going to give up anytime soon.</p>

### Forbidden Island
 <p> This group session was a great session. I had fun learning about the game and sitting down with my teammates and getting to know them a little more was a great exercise. Alana has a natural ability to lead and she is great at it. She told us that if she gets bossy to let her know haha but she was great. Denelle also has a natural ability to lead so having two strong leadership role to follow for me is good. All together our communication is great. We jumped in the game right away since we had only 45mins so I set a timer and we got started right away. We went line by line according to the instructions and as we went along the way we each had a stragety and we voiced it and if someone had a better idea we collobrated it and we won. We finised right about 44mins and some seconds so we accomplised it!.</p>

### Visual Speaks
![Visual Speaks](IdentityPic.jpg)
<p>The first picture symbolizes hope and prayer and it best represents where I am at in this point of my life. Right now changing career paths stepping into something totally different is a very scary process. So I send my prayers to a higher power to help guide me through the next phase of my life. On top of that: daily studying, re-reading chapters, and extra research helps with the process of understanding everything. All I can say is that I "hope and pray" that this will be enough to finish off this bootcamp.</p>
<p> The second picture show where I will be at in three years. I picked the glowing fireworks because I see myself glowing with a company that appreciates my work and skills. I want to be accomplishing something great.</p>

### Who am I?
 <p> I am a Java/ Android Developer taking and internship with the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp( I am working with Hope Technologies)</p>
 <p> I attended my first 1 Million Cups event and that was so great! Me and my career buddy Jeff Franklin made some awesome connections and we both motivated each other at the same time. It was a great event. I got 3 business cards #1 Sarah Mcord, she was selling some of her art work and she was a great person to talk too. #2 Deidre Grabke She overheard my converstions with Denelle about making some business cards for myself and she recommeded the place she got hers done. We chit-chatted for a while and I told her who I was and gave my line of " My name is Anita Martin I am a future Software Programmer and currently taking a Deep Dive Bootcamp" #3 David? did not get his last name. Funny story I was walking near the front and I tripped on the microphone and he ask if I was ok. "Way to go Anita!" I thought but that was my first connections so it made my first connection memorable. Overall the event was fantastic I also made another career buddy, Janal Sanchez from the Digital Media bootcamp. Making those connections for sure!</p>

### Quanititive Accomplishments
   - Working at DISH I oversaw just under one Million dollars of inventory. I had to track it, order it, ship it out mainly watch our shrink on it.
   - I was also in charge of overseeing about 70-90 technicians’ individual inventory. We had to replenish every week to make sure they did not run out of equipment for installs.
   - We had about 90 vehicles in our fleet so I had to maintain the maintacnce on them. From oil changes, brake changes, windshield replacements, etc..

### Qualitative Accomplishment
   - Great communicator – I have a great communications skills through emails, phone etiquette, and face-to-face. Large groups usually more than 20 I start to panic a little. 
   - Organizer - I am a great organizer, as I have eveything that I need to do in my calender. What I was taught was "Make time for it or you won't get to it."
   - People person - I have a belief that we are our own individual person and that makes us unique. So I like to talk to people, even though I know I come across as shy or in my own zone, once I start to warm up to people I like to have conversations about everything.
    
### What do I bring to the table?
<p>Warehouse Inventory process – knew the ends and outs of the process of inventory related tasks.
Great with people – I had about at 70 to 90 techs that I was working with to track inventory on a weekly schedule. Used email, phone and person-to-person interactions.Great under pressure – working with deadlines when projects were pushed on to me. Had a time frame of due by the end of the day or a month.Well organized – kept our warehouse organized so that we can easily pull items quickly and efficiently.
Excel was my friend – I had to work on a daily basis with excel building models to help track inventory, building schedules to help keep track of things that were completed and not completed.Hard worker – all the positions that I held I started off from the very bottom and worked my way to a management position.</p>

    
### Whole Brain Accomplishment
<p>My passion product now is building small furniture out of pallets. The way this get incorporated with using my whole brain is being creative as to what I want to build. The other side is making sure that I construct it correctly. Measurements match up.</p>
